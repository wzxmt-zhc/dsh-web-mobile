/**
 * Sidebar drawer swipe gestures (B 档 hybrid follow, per the 2026-08-29
 * controlled upgrade of docs/specs/2026-08-27-sidebar-swipe-gestures.md).
 *
 * Three gestures:
 * - edge swipe-in: the pointer goes down within the start zone (45% of the
 *   left edge) and the drawer is closed → the host state is flipped AT
 *   AXIS-LOCK (early commit) while the drawer is pinned in its closed slot,
 *   so the REAL open subtree mounts off-screen and then follows the finger
 *   out of the slot (see startFollow for why the flip has to come first);
 * - content swipe-toward-slot: the pointer goes down inside the open drawer
 *   and drags LEFT (LTR) → the drawer FOLLOWS the finger (inline translateX,
 *   transition:none) and releases into the host's transition;
 * - content swipe-out (legacy): drag RIGHT inside the open drawer → no
 *   follow (A 档 semantics preserved verbatim), release classifies.
 *
 * The release decision is UNCHANGED from A 档: classifySwipe (distance ratio
 * OR recent-window velocity) — after a follow stroke, dx IS the followed
 * position, so the same function decides complete vs spring-back. The commit
 * is still just `ctx.layout.toggleSidebar()`. The follow mechanics ride the
 * host transition instead of fighting it: during the stroke the drawer gets
 * inline `transition: none` + translateX; on release the inline styles are
 * dropped and the commit retargets the host transition IN THE SAME TASK (no
 * paint in between), so the drawer animates from the finger position to the
 * final state with zero custom animation code.
 *
 * Review constraints honored (spec 2026-08-27 second review): the backdrop
 * stays binary (appears at commit — never opacity-followed, 缺陷 2); a modal
 * rising mid-stroke reverts the drawer every move event (缺陷 1's per-frame
 * guard); the OPEN final state must end with transform:none (the containing
 * block invariant for fixed descendants) — a transitionend-free cleanup pair
 * (inline clear + host value) guarantees it because the host open rule is
 * transform:none. No gesture-layer DOM, no setPointerCapture. Zero transform
 * writes remain true for the LEGACY rightward-close path.
 *
 * Coexistence with the host's overlay interactions (document capture click /
 * pointerup) is two-layered via gesture-guard.ts: (1) tryLock publishes an
 * axis-lock flag the instant the stroke locks horizontal — during
 * pointermove, strictly before any pointerup — and the host handlers yield
 * on it first, because they are registered EARLIER and the post-release
 * consume marks do not exist yet on the stroke's own release event (audit
 * S0: the host toggled first and the gesture toggled back, net zero);
 * (2) a classified swipe additionally marks its target chain consumed so
 * the synthetic click after the stroke can never toggle twice or navigate
 * a row.
